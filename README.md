# Effective Feedback

## Purpose

The purpose of this course is to teach you, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, how to master the art of effective feedback.
Understanding how to give good feedback is an indispensible tool for your career, whatever that may be. Not only will it make you better at communicating appropriately to your peers, manager and team, it will also make you appreciate and comprehend their feedback better.

However, as software engineers we have a particular form of feedback: code review. The process of submitting code for your peers to comment on (or reviewing other's contributions) is a permanent task for us. As such, there are certain specific aspects to code review which we will touch on in this course, in an effort to make it especially relevant and useful for you.

## How the course is structured

We have 11 lessons for you, which we designed to be followed sequentially:

1. Concepts about feedback. [Theory](/lessons/01_concepts_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/01_concepts_practice.md)
1. The objective of feedback. [Theory](/lessons/02_objective_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/02_objective_practice.md)
1. Characteristics of effective feedback. [Theory](/lessons/03_characteristics_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/03_characteristics_practice.md)
1. Pitfalls of innefective feedback. [Theory](/lessons/04_innefective_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/04_innefective_practice.md)
1. Specificity of feedback I: differentiating general from specific feedback. [Theory](/lessons/05_specificity_diff_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/05_specificity_diff_practice.md)
1. Specificity of feedback II: the trip from general to specific feedback. [Theory](/lessons/06_specificity_change_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/06_specificity_change_practice.md)
1. Back to the Future IV: the feedforward. [Theory](/lessons/07_feedforward_intro_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/07_feedforward_intro_practice.md)
1. Feedback and feedforward: the differences. [Theory](/lessons/08_feedforward_diff_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/08_feedforward_diff_practice.md)
1. From feedback to feedforward. [Theory](/lessons/09_feedforward_change_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/09_feedforward_change_practice.md)
1. Asking for effective feedback. [Theory](/lessons/10_asking_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/10_asking_practice.md)
1. Code review: the bits and bytes of feedback. [Theory](/lessons/11_code_review_theory.md) [Practice](/lessons/11_code_review_practice.md)

Each has a theoretical component, followed by a practical component where you can exercise what you just learned. You should submit the practical component by:

1. Forking this repo on github;
1. Solving the exercises on any branch other than `main`;
1. Create a pull request (to merge the branch into your mainline branch) and add a professor as a reviewer.

This method yields multiple benefits. First, the pull request is the primary tool for code review on github (other platforms have similar features with different names). Second, it allows the professors to give you feedback directly, exercising the types of interactions you will likely have in your professional setting.

## Meta-Feedback

We encourage everyone to open an issue with questions or suggestions, and pull requests are appreciated!
