# 8. Feedback and feedforward. The differences: Theory

## What makes feedforward different from feedback?

The main concept that makes feedforward different from feedback is that feedforward focuses in the future, while all the conversation of the feedback stays in the past (McDowall, A., Freemann, K. and Marshall, K. ,2014).

Behaviors associated with the feedback:

- There are times when people will receive negative feedback, people may enter into a stress mental state. Since they are hearing or reading about a behavior that they already did and may not be sure if they can change it or not (Joe Hirsch, 2018).
- Feedback often focuses in grading the past behaviors. If they were well enough or not. The problem is that it focuses too much into a behavior that already occurred without specifying any future action plan.
- If the feedback is given in an inappropriate  way it can reinforce negative behaviors  As Joe Hirsh (2018) mentioned  during his interview with Cult of Pedadogy:

  "And it doesn’t always go well. As we give and receive feedback, people get defensive. Feelings get hurt. Too often, the improvements we’re going for don’t happen, because the feedback isn’t given in a way that the receiver can embrace."


Behaviors associated with the fastforward:

- As already stated, feedforward focuses in the future. So, all the talk given during a feedforward will help the reciver of it, to think how to accomplish a goal.
- Feedforward focuses in the solutions. How, given a specific situation, the person can solve that and enhance their previous beahavior. As M. Goldsmith (2015) states, feedback will search how to solve a problem, while feedback will focus in the problem.
- "Point a problem, only if you have a solution or a suggestion" (Hirsh, J. , 2018). This behavior enables that at the moment of giving feedback the possible actions can expand. For applying this, people can take advantage of the "What if" word in order to propose alternative actions to the original one.
