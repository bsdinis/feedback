# 7. Back to the Future IV. The feedforward: Theory

## Origins of the term feedforward

The term of feedback is a word that most of the people is familiar with, but in 1951 I.A. Richards develop the term of feedforward. In Richards' words (1951, as cited in Logan 2015), feedforward stands in opposition to feedback. While feedback is reactive, the feedforward is proactive, since it anticipates to the the goals . While I.A. Richards focused more in the technology applications of the concept feedforward, several decades later  Marshall Goldsmith adapted this term to a specific framework of how to start using this feedforward as a technique to improve behaviors (Marshall Goldsmith, 2015).


## Main concept of feedforward

[Feedforward concept explained by Marshall Goldsmith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFX74GIxca4&ab_channel=MarshallGoldsmith) (marshallgoldsmith, 2007)


The feedforward focuses in the future, what behaviors we can modify taking into account our actions from the past. It is as the actions can be  the inputs of a set of future actions that will end in an enhanced version of themselves, overall the feedforward need to cover some principles:

- Define a goal.
- What has happened before that could be a show stopper for the previous defined goal?
- Which are the available options? For this options, the lessons learned from the previous failed attempts need to be taken into account.
- How can we achieve this goal? The feedforward should specify concrete actions to achieve the goals.

As it is explained here, the main point of the feedforward is to focus in changing the behaviors or influencing in them, while using previous experiences.

## Advantages of feedforward

- The reception of the people is better, since we are taking previous experiences and trying to see how they can be improved. It is easier to search how to improve than to probe why a specific action was wrong.
- The people that receive feedforward can be aware of which specific actions they need to take in order to improve their previous attempts.
- The people involved in the dynamic of giving-taking feedforward do not need to know between themselves. It's enough that the giver of feedforward has knowledge about the topic, so they can seek ways to improve.

## Examples of feedforward?

- "In your last code review I noticed that you use Pascal Case for your variables, have you heard of the Camel case format? This format is the one used in our team and you can read more about this specific format in the documentation. For the next iteration would be great if you can include the Camel case format, since we always try to have a consistent style in our code"

- "I noticed that in your last commit there were several programs using several nested *if* clauses. There is another option to this lines, which is a switch clause. I can recommend you to check the online documentation for this switch clause and try to implement it in the next commit, you will enjoy this learning experience. Additionally, it will improve the readability of the code, which will benefit you at the end, since it will be easier to understand your code."
