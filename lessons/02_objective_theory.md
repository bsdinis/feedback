# 2. The objective of feedback: Theory

##  What are the main goals of giving feedback?

### Modify behaviors

Whenever you are giving feedback, you are in a position of potentially helping somebody else, the person who is on the receiving end, improve their **behavior**, which could be a specific action or even a pattern that they are showing.

Ideally, this feedback would help **enhance** the way in which they approach different situations, tasks, responsibilities, and consequently how they perform in a certain environment.

### Maintain behaviors

On the other hand, sometimes you want to let somebody know that what they have been doing has been working well, or that the latest change that they introduced in their behavior or actions has been a positive one, and the best way to do that is through **positive feedback**.

Also, there are many times where people would truly appreciate for others - their colleagues, friends - to notice an improvement that they have made, or to value how good they are at a specific job or task, and to know that just as they can receiving feedback to improve on something, they can also receive an encouraging, positive one.
