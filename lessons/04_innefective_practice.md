|:-----------------:|:------------|:--------------|
|  The code addition you did at line 87 should be changed, it slows down performance. Please look for an alternative. |    |    |

| How you last spoke at the meeting was not okay. Avoid it for future ones. |    |    |
|  The way in which you last spoke at the meeting was slightly fast-paced, I don't think everybody could keep up with your words. Avoid speaking so fast for future ones.  |    |    |
