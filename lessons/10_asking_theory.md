# 10. Asking for effective feedback: Theory

### Goals

1. Understand the importance of seeking out feedback;
2. Understand who to ask feedback to;
3. Identify strategies for asking for feedback;
4. Implement strategies for asking for feedback.

## Why do we need to ask for feedback

Feedback invariantly has two agents: the reviewer and the reviewee. Individually, we can be great at doling out feedback and also great at receiving it and incorporating it into our work. However, some may not be as atuned to the craft of feedback, and need to be gently nudged in that direction.

Coming back to the example of code review: you may have coded your feature, having it fully tested and ready to be merged: if you don't open a pull request (which is an established procedure to ask for review), no one will ever look at your code.

Note that, in general, asking for feedback is not quite as straightforward as clicking a button. You may need to consider your peer's expertise in effective feedback and guide them in the process.

## Who to ask for feedback: talk to the manager and peers

Generally, your manager is a great person to ask for feedback. They are, after all, the one who is responsible for the overall performance of the team of which you are a part of. Likewise, your peers are obvious candidates for feedback: they interact with you and your work closely.

## Who to ask for feedback: "But I'm the manager"

Being the manager is not a problem at all. You can (and should) ask your team for feedback, which has a multitude of extra benefits:

 1. It gives you awareness about your performance
 2. By asking for feedback, you build trust among your team. This reduces the _yes-man_ phenomenon [3], which can be harmful to your workplace environment for a multitude of reasons [4].
 3. It incentivises your team to ask feedback for themselves.

## How to ask for feedback

### Spontaneous Feedback

Whenever you feel like you need input concerning your performance, you should feel free to ask for feedback. In this case, make sure to:

 - Set aside a time with someone to discuss your performance;
 - Prepare some questions to guide the other person;
 - Ask open questions, ideally focusing on specific aspects. This helps to gather specific feedback.


### Structured Feedback

In addition to spontaneous feedback, most organizations have some form of structured feedback (sometimes called performance review), where you are evaluated (and evaluate others) periodically.
Although this varies with the organization, the feedback is given in a prompted manner. This means that instead of you having to dig into the other person to extract feedback from them, the prompt does it for you.
However, it is still important to analyse the feedback you received in written and know how to approach the oral discussion. Don't forget to:

 - Carefully read the feedback you received. This shows you paid attention and that you value the other person's contribution;
 - Thank the other person for the feedback. This shows your appreciation for the time spent preparing the good feedback;
 - Ask specific clarificating questions. The oral discussion need not go over all the points of the written feedback, only the ones you (and the other person) feel need to be addressed.
