In this exercise you will read different examples that you need to transform from **feedback** into **feedforward**:

1. **Feedback**: "The presentation slides you last submitted had many orthographic errors. This can't keep happening."

        Feedforward: 

1. **Feedback**: "The latest code you submitted was very complicated to read."

        Feedforward: 

1. **Feedback**: "The latest code you wrote was missing the correct initialization techniques, which is why it fails sometimes."

        Feedforward: 

1. **Feedback**: "You spoke too slow on this presentation, people were bored and tired of listening to the topic."

        Feedforward: 

1. **Feedback**: "You were disruptive in the last meeting, always being distracted by your colleagues."
