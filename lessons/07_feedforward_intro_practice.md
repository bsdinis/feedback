# 7. Back to the Future IV. The feedforward: Practice

Hey! Thanks for all your help in the previous exercises, your help will almost finish but before that, we just need your help in a very important part. Amazonia managers started reading about this technique of feedforward. Most probably, you are already aware of this so, I would like you to do the following.

1) Since management has been researching about feedforward, they would like to understand the points that make "feedforward" a good asset for the company. Please, mention some advantages:




2) During a meeting, management start to think in examples of feedforward. Can you indicate if they are or not?

Example 1:

"We would like that you study the comments from the previous code reviews. If notice, there is a trend about your coding style. What we recommend is to check the trainings 1, 2 and 3 that you will find in the onboarding site. Once you go through this trainings, try to apply that knowledge in your future commits. You will see how your coding will improve"

Is it feedforward?
Why ?

Example 2:

"Your past commits had not been the best. You should have paid more attention to the previous comments, that way you would have less errors"

Is it feedforward?
Why?
