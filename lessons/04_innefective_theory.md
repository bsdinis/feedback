## Consequences of giving innefective feedback

We have already seen many of the elements that constitute giving good and effective feedback. Now, we will see the other side of the coin, presenting some of the consequences that come from providing **innefective feedback**.

This can have even more consequences, like making you change your behavior in situations where you did not need to change, or to not change at all and continuing to make the same mistakes.

1.  Feeling unmotivated

    When receiving inneffective feedback, this can cause you to start feeling less motivated to learn and improve, since its not easy to know what actions to change when you have been "criticized personally" instead of receiving effective feedback, or when the feedback focused mmainly on how "terrible" the mistake or error was, instead of on what you can do to improve in the future.
