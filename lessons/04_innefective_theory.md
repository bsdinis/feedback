# 4. Pitfalls of ineffective feedback: Theory

## Consequences of giving ineffective feedback

We have already seen many of the elements that constitute giving good and effective feedback. Now, we will see the other side of the coin, presenting some of the consequences that come from providing **ineffective feedback**.

### 1. Feeling confused and misunderstood:

    If the received feedback was not clear and specific, and it doesn't come with suggestions for the future, you can end up feeling confused about what is expected from you, what exactly you did wrong, and what you could do to improve it. This can have even more consequences, like making you change your behavior in situations where you did not need to change or, to not change at all and continuing to make the same mistakes, as explained in the article (Secrets of Effective Feedback: Knowing What to Avoid, 2019)

    Also, this could happen when the person who has received feedback didn't have a chance to explain themselves or give their own opinion when they received the feedback.

### 2. Feeling disrespected:

    If the feedback was very harsh and it focused on personality traits instead of on a specific behavior or action, then you might be left feeling insulted and disrespected, like they don't value your efforts and your work. Also, this could happen when the person who has received feedback didn't have a chance to explain themselves or give their own opinion when they received

### 3.  Feeling unmotivated

    When receiving ineffective feedback, this can cause you to start feeling less motivated to learn and improve, since it is not easy to know what actions to change when you have been "criticized personally", or when the feedback focused mainly on how "terrible" the mistake or error was, instead of on what you can do to improve in the future.
