# 6. Specificity of feedback II. The trip from general to specific feedback: Practice

Hi again! Now you need to help us in the next section. Taking into account the code reviews from the section 5, now we need your expertise into converting this generic feedback to specific feedback. Please, leave your comments below.

1st Task.
Taking into account this code review from Pedro:

>PedroAmazonia comments:
>
>Hi Diego! I left some comments in the code, please check them.
>
> The code in general was good. Although I think you can still make some improvements in it. Please, try to make them and commit the changes so I can review them.

How can you improve it? Please write below your own version of this feedback. Take into account that, obviously, you don't know which was the code from Diego, so feel free to make up scenarios for the specific feedback. Our main point here is to show Pedro an example of specific feedback.

Specific Feedback:



2nd Task.
Try to improve this review from Ana

>AnaAmazonia comments:
>
>Hi NÃ©stor! I loved how you implemented the functions in your program. Although there were some parts in the code that you didn't follow some of the best practices. Try to double check this and commit the code again.

After you identified in the previous section that the feedback was too general, we asked Ana which are some of the good practices that Amazonia has. She answered this:

- Use of Camel Syntax for the functions.
- The name of the variables should specify the purpose of it.
- Use the existent libraries, no need to reinvent the wheel.

To make the specific feedback for Ana's previous code review you might want to take the previous points into consideration.
