# 2. The objective of feedback: Practice

Now we are going to present to you different scenarios in which you need to mark down with an **'X'** the option that you would prefer more and why: 

1. Imagine you are doing a project and one of your colleagues always asks you right before they start working on any task, whether small or big, your opinion and if you agree with what they will do. Some people would like this, and others wouldn't. What about you? Would you want them to maintain *or* modify this behavior? 

    |Modify behavior|Maintain behavior|         Why        |
    |:-------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------|
    |      __       |        __       | (your reason here) |


2. Now, imagine that in a programming group project, a colleague adds comments on 60% of the code that they write because they think this makes the code more understandable. Would you want them to maintain *or* modify this behavior? 

    |Modify behavior|Maintain behavior|         Why        |
    |:-------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------|
    |      __       |        __       | (your reason here) |


3. In a similar scenario as before, what about if instead of commenting 60% of the code, they do not add comments at all. Would you want them to maintain or modify this behavior? 

    |Modify behavior|Maintain behavior|         Why        |
    |:-------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------|
    |      __       |        __       | (your reason here) |
