# 9. From feedback to feedforward: Theory

## How do we switch from feedback to feedforward?

As we have now seen in the previous sections, one of the elements that can be seen as a "flaw" of feedback is its *criticism* element and how it focuses on how we acted or what we did in the past, in many cases making us feel demotivated, frustrated with ourselves and others, etc.

As Jason Lauritsen (2021) says, "that’s a problem because we can’t change past performance. It’s history. Simply knowing what I did wrong (or right) in the past does nothing to guarantee my future performance or behavior will change for the better."

*So then, what steps should we follow to make sure we are evolving from feedback into feedforward?*

The first step is to identify a **specific** behavior or action that you want someone else to improve on, whether that is because of a past action, just as you would before giving feedback, or as an idea for their future approach, not necessarily because they already did it a certain way.

Then, you should think of suggestions and advice for the **future** that the person could apply, which reinforces the other person's motivation to be their best possible version. This means that you want the other person to expand their potential and their skills, and through the received advice or suggestion they can get an actual foundation to work from.


Some examples of feedforward sentences would be:

* "In the future, I suggest that you make your presentation slides with only 10-20 words maximum per slide."
* "For next programming project deliveries, I recommend leaving a lot of time for adding explanatory comments to the more complicated lines of code."

Notice how these examples reinforce the future-oriented approach of feedforward and do not focus on the past mistake or behavior.
