# 1. Concepts about feedback: Pracice

## Exercise 1

In your own words, explain what feedback is.


## Exercise 2

Give 4 new examples of feedback. Try to showcase positive and negative feedback examples.


## Exercise 3 [Extra]

You should come back to this exercise when you've learned to differenciate effective feedback from poor feedback.
Recall the examples given in the theory part.

 - "I really liked your performance this week"
 - "I especially appreciated your openness to help others, as you did with Francisco"
 - "I did not care for your tardiness"
 - "Generally, you can improve"

Which of these can be construed as *effective* feedback? For the ones you did not choose, rewrite them so as to make them effective feedback.
