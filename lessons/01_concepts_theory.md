# 1. Concepts about feedback: Theory

### Goals

By the end of this class you should be able to:

1. Articulate what feedback is;

2. Give examples of feedback.

## Feedback

This course is designed to enable you to give you the tools to properly give and receive effective feedback. However, it is crucial to first properly understand what feedback is, so that we can give it (and receive it) with intent.

Feedback can be thought of as commentary given by an entity regarding certain aspects of a person's knowledge about a subject or their performance, *aimed at changing negative behaviours and reinforcing positive ones* [1, 2].

This by itself is incredibly generic, and may not be enough for one to understand when feedback is being dealt. Consider the following examples:

 - "I really liked your performance this week"
 - "I especially appreciated your openness to help others, as you did with Francisco"
 - "I did not care for your tardiness"
 - "Generally, you can improve"

Note that some of these examples are positive and others are negative. Furthermore, as we'll see in the course, some of these are poor feedback, while others are good.
