# 5. Specificity of feedback I. Differentiating general from specific feedback: Theory

## Which is the correct way of giving feedback?

There are scenarios where a person receives feedback from their team of from someone else and at the end of the session, they are still confused about what they need to correct. One of the possible reasons of this scenario is the fact that the feedback is not specific enough.

## Characteristics of general feedback

| Characteristics | Example | Effect |
| --------------- | ------  | ------ |
| Vague comments  | "The code of your last submission is not good enough"       |  The developer in charge of that part of the code will not know what he or she can do in order to improve  |
| Does not indicate which behavior can improve | "One colleague did not like your last commit" | There's a lot of open questions, why the did not the code? Is it a technical aspect? Is ii that the guidelines were not followed? There is no specific point on where to take an action |
| Does not encourage any change in the behavior | "The code was awful, probably we will not use it" | This type of feedback has many errors, but one of them is that it is not focused in improving a behavior, it's just pointing out errors |

## Characteristics of specific feedback

| Characteristics | Example | Effect |
| --------------- | ------  | ------ |
| Indicates specific behaviors | "The previous commit "
