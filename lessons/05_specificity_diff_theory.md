# 5. Specificity of feedback I. Differentiating general from specific feedback: Theory

## Why giving specific feedback is important?

There are scenarios where a person receives feedback from their team  and at the end of the session they are still confused about what they need to correct. One of the possible reasons of this scenario is the fact that the feedback was not specific enough.

Let's keep in mind the definition of the feedback which is "information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter which is used to alter the gap in some way" (Ramaprasad, 1983).

So, if the person who delivers the feedback does not explain the reference or the actual level in a explicit and comprehensible way, the person that is receiving the feedback will not know how to fill that gap of information.


## Characteristics of general feedback

| Characteristics | Example | Effect |
| --------------- | ------  | ------ |
| Vague comments. | "The code of your last submission was not good enough"       |  The developer in charge of that part of the code will not know what he or she can do in order to improve. |
| Does not indicate which behavior can improve. | "One colleague did not like your last commit". | There's a lot of open questions, why they did not like the code? Is it a technical aspect? Is it that the guidelines were not followed? There is no specific point on where to take an action. |
| Does not encourage any change in the behavior. | "The code was awful, probably we will not use it" | This type of feedback has many errors, but one of them is that it is not focused in improving a behavior, it's just pointing out errors. |

## Characteristics of specific feedback

| Characteristics | Example | Effect |
| --------------- | ------  | ------ |
| Indicates specific behaviors  | "The previous commit was not complete because you did not add any message indicating the changes" | Specific goals are more effective than general or nonspecific ones, primarily because they focus people's attention, so there can be an actual change (John Hattie & Helen Timperley, 2007, p. 87)|
| It is transparent | "At the moment of submitting, I need you to follow the article X from the training. There you will find some guidelines about the interfaces that you are allowed to use for this project. The ones that you used were not correct and added an extra problem to solve" | There are no puzzles in the communication, what needs to be done or corrected is communicated in a transparent way. The person that receives the feedback will understand clearly what actions they did (John Hattie & Helen Timperley, 2007, p. 87).|
| Relate to a measurable goal | "With the previous commit of the code, you surpassed the threshold of 21 errors by program, take this into consideration". | When the feedback can relate to a measurable goal, almost 46% of the people can improve their actions (John Hattie & Helen Timperley, 2007, Table 2).
