# 5. Specificity of feedback I. Differentiating general from specific feedback: Practice


Hi! You were just hired to identify improvements in the behavior of code reviewers that work in the company Amazonia. Your first task will be to review this code review from Pedro, one of the Jr. engineers in Amazonia that just started giving code reviews to some of the interns in the company.

Please, read the following code reviews and identify if there is any room for improvement.

1st Code Review.
Context: This is one of the first programs from Diego, a very new intern at Amazonia to which Pedro left a code review some days ago. Please check if the code review can be improved. For now, it is not necessary to recommend changes, you will be able to do this task in our next sessions.

>Hi Diego! I left some comments in the code, please check them.
>
> The code in general was good. Although I think you can still make some improvements in it. Please, try to make them and commit the changes so I can review them.

Question: Does this feedback provide enough information to Diego of what he needs to improve or at least, where he needs to put emphasis in his code?
Answer:


2nd Code Review.
Context: The past week there was a dinner in Amazonia for the Sr. engineers, unfortuntely many of them suffer from food poisoning and they didn't come to work for some days. During that days only Ana was doing code reviews. When the other Sr. engineers arrived again to the work, they  mentioned that the feedback was not clear enough. Please, check it and determine if Ana gave general or specific feedback in his code reviews.

>Hi Néstor! I loved how you implemented the functions in your program. Although there were some parts in the code that you didn't follow some of the best practices. Try to double check this and commit the code again.

Question: Did Ana give general or specific feedback to Néstor?
