# 3. Characteristics of effective feedback: Theory

Now we are going to present the most important characteristics of effective feedback

1. Effective feedback must be **specific**:

    In relation to a task, action or, behavior, the given or received feedback should be specific and detailed. This indicates that the feedback is focused on actually driving and allowing an improvement to happen since it's much more feasible for somebody to improve their behavior if the feedback was task-oriented, which gives them a base to grow from since they know the exact situation being described.

1. Effective feedback should be **meaningful**:

    This means that the feedback needs to have a backbone to what it's trying to convey, a supported reason why it is being said or given, and can be acted upon.

1. Effective feedback should focus on the **person's actions**:

    Author Leo Babauta (2007) says, "Never criticize the person. Always criticize the actions. And when youâ€™re making suggestions, make suggestions about actions, not about the person".

    When giving effective feedback to someone, you should focus on their actions and behaviors, not on their personality or the person themselves. This means that if you want them to understand the feedback and give them room to improve, then make it less about the person as a whole and more about the actions.

    "However, remember to always keep your feedback meaningful. Praising effort is another easy trap to fall into" (Jory MacKay, 2017). This is also a very important factor to remember. You can't forget to be honest and truthful to what you are saying for fear of being too harsh, since some feedback will be harder to give than others, and we should not hide what we really need to say. There is always a good balance to be found between honesty and directness.


1. Effective feedback should be at an **appropriate time and place**:

    When giving feedback, you should prepare for the meeting and arrange the best possible conditions for it, time and location-wise, for the people involved in the process.

    Most people prefer a quiet or private location, where they can be comfortable and have the space to react and process what is being said and present their own position.

    Also, it should account for having enough time for the meeting. There is no point in giving feedback if this is going to be given so quickly that the person can't tell you their own thoughts.

1. Effective feedback should be **future-oriented**:

    Whenever you give feedback, you need to remember that you can't change something that went wrong in the past, because mistakes happen to everybody - can only learn from them -. Therefore, it's not necessary to focus solely on understanding what caused and how the mistake or error took place: "*this* happened, which caused *this*, and your involvement was *this*", but to also put a more positive and future-oriented focus on it, making reference to how and what they can do on the future to avoid the same thing from happening.

   >  There is a section dedicated to explaining and expanding on this subject and its details later on in this course, which is also known as _["feedforward"](07_feedforward_intro_theory.md)_.

There are many other elements that can help in building effective feedback, and these can be more helpful to some people than others, since we are all different people and sometimes we can be more receptive in certain scenarios than in others, but one key thing to always have present is to: give feedback as we would like to receive it. This means we should attempt to put ourselves in the other person's position and take this into account when we elaborate on the feedback we want to give.
